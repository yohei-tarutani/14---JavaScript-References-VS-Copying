      // start with strings, numbers and booleans

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy", ["Yohei", "Motegi"]];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const team = players;
      // team[3] = "Lux";
      console.log(players, team);

      // You might think we can just do something like this:

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const team2 = players.slice(); // Shallow copy (all of below as well)
      team2[3] = "Yohei";
      // team2[4][0] = "Henry";
      console.log(players, team2);

      const team3 = [].concat(players);

      const team4 = [...players];
      team4[3] = "Bob";
      console.log(players, team4);

      const team5 = Array.from(players);
      team5[3] = "Merissa";
      console.log(players, team5);

      const team6 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(players)); // Dedp copy (when converting "players" into an object with strings, it became no longer a reference.)
      team6[4][0] = "Henry";
      console.log(players, team6);

      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in

      // or use the new ES6 Spread

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };
      // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person;
      captain.number = 99;
      console.log(person, captain);

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {
        number: 7,
        height: 180,
      });
      console.log(person, captain2);

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const captain3 = { ...person };
      captain3.age = 12;
      console.log(person, captain3);

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
      const wes = {
        name: "Wes",
        age: 100,
        social: {
          twitter: "@wesbos",
          facebook: "wesbos.developer",
        },
      };

      // console.clear();
      // console.log(wes);

      const dev = Object.assign({}, wes); // Shallow copy (only one level)
      dev.name = "Yohei";
      // dev.social.twitter = "@Yohei";
      console.log(wes, dev);

      const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes)); // Depp copy (when converting "wes" into a abject with strings, it became no longer a reference.)
